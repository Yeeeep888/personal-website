      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a collector of experiences, a connector of ideas, and a creator of small beautiful things.</p>

        My path hasn't been linear—it's been a constellation of discoveries, each one illuminating different aspects of who I am and what matters most. I believe in depth over breadth, yet find myself constantly drawn to new horizons of knowledge and creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The apparent contradictions in my interests actually form a coherent whole: my love for technology balanced by appreciation for analog processes; my enjoyment of solitary creative work complemented by meaningful human connections; my practical skills grounded in philosophical curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thread that ties everything together is a desire to notice what others might miss, and to create spaces—both physical and digital—where authenticity and thoughtfulness can flourish.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still very much a work in progress, learning to embrace the beautiful uncertainty of becoming. This website itself is an evolving reflection of that journey, never quite finished but always genuinely me.
